**Photo App Discovery Service**
==============================

A Eureka Discovery Service project built using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, designed to manage service discovery and registration for a microservices-based photo application. The service allows other microservices to register and deregister themselves, and provides a registry of available services for client-side discovery and load balancing.

**Key Features:**

* Service discovery and registration using Eureka Server
* Supports multiple instances of services for load balancing and failover
* Provides a registry of available services for client-side discovery
* Built using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud for easy configuration and deployment

**Purpose:**

The Photo App Discovery Service is designed to provide a centralized registry of available services for a microservices-based photo application. This allows other microservices to easily discover and communicate with each other, and enables features like load balancing and failover.
